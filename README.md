# Propofol-related adverse events: the association between propofol infusion, triglyceride levels, and acute pancreatitis: A multi-center epidemiologic analysis
All code for the analyses is incldued here. 

# Abstract 
Rationale: Propofol is the first-line sedative-hypnotic agent for critically ill adults requiring mechanical ventilation. While propofol can elevate triglyceride levels, and the latter is a risk factor for pancreatitis, the causality of propofol with acute pancreatitis is unclear.

Objectives: Determine the clinical impact and potential causality between propofol infusion, hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis.

Methods: This is a multi-center study of adults admitted to an intensive care unit. requiring mechanical ventilation and receiving continuous propofol infusion for at least 24h The primary outcomes were the frequency of hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis. Further analyses determined the clinical impact of elevated triglyceride levels (sedation changes) and risk factors for pancreatitis development. 

Measurements and Main Results: Of 11,828 patients included, 33.2% (3922) had triglyceride levels measured, of whom 21.7% (851) had hypertriglyceridemia at 4.5 (SD: 6.8) days after propofol initiation. Of those still requiring sedation, 70.4% (576/818) received alternative sedatives following hypertriglyceridemia. Pancreatitis occurred in 1.2% (47/3922) and was more frequent in those with hypertriglyceridemia (3.2%, 27/851 versus 0.7%, 20/3071; P<0.001). Following adjustment for potential confounding variables, each 100 mg/dL increase in triglyceride levels was associated with a 11% increase in risk of pancreatitis. Propofol dose was not associated with pancreatitis development. 

Conclusions: Acute pancreatitis is uncommon in patients receiving propofol infusion, and occurs over a wide range of triglyceride levels, indicating multifactorial pathophysiology. Hypertriglyceridemia frequently prompts use of alternative sedatives. Further study is needed to determine how to best monitor and treat hypertriglyceridemia in critically ill patients.
